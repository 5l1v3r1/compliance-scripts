Scripts used in the OSADL License Compliance Audit: http://lca.osadl.org/

Included in this directory are:

* audit.config -- same configuration file for audit script and database creation script
* kerneldownload.py -- simple kernel archive downloader
* osadlaudit.py -- audit script
* osadldb.py -- database creation script
* lca.sql -- database table definitions for PostgreSQL
* lca-drop.sql -- SQL to quickly drop all tables using psql
* README -- this file

A few dependencies are needed:
    * tlsh (optional)
    * requests (optional, just for downloader script)
    * ScanCode
    * FOSSology (uses "nomossa", the standalone Nomos scanner for people who do not want to install/use/configure all of FOSSology. This can easily be replaced by the path of the regular "nomos" if there is already an existing FOSSology installation)

Installing ScanCode:

1. git clone https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit
2. run the scancode program once so it self-configures
3. add the path of the scancode program to the configuration file (example: "audit.config")

Creating the database:

The database creation script requires PostgreSQL 9.5 or later and a recent psycopg2.

1. install PostgreSQL. This is outside of the scope of this document.

2. create a database and a user, for example:

create database osadl;
create user osadl with password 'osadl';
grant all privileges on database osadl to osadl;

Populating the database:

This step is not needed if a prefab database is used (available from OSADL for OSADL members).

1. download the Linux kernel source code releases (only tar.xz files are downloaded), or use a previously downloaded collection of downloaded sources. For both the "kerneldownload.py" script should be used to generate the correct metadata that is used:

$ python3 kerneldownload.py -d /path/to/directory/with/tarballs

2. un the "osadldb.py" script. This script uses a configuration file. An example with some default values and their explanations can be found in "audit.config". The settings relevant to the database creation are in the [createdatabase] section.

$ python3 osadldb.py -d /path/to/directory/with/tarballs -c /path/to/configuration/file

This problem is I/O bound.

Running the audit script:

The audit script uses a configuration file. An example with some default values and their explanations can be found in "audit.config". The settings relevant to the audt are in the "audit" section.

$ python3 osadlaudit -s /path/to/directory/with/sources/to/scan -c /path/to/configuration/file
