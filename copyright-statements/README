Script that takes a JSON output file from ScanCode, plus a directory path, and generates a simple copyright notices file. This is a very rough proof of concept script.

The following should be noted: this script only processes what ScanCode reports. If there is a bug in ScanCode, or if the output from ScanCode is not complete because it does not recognize for example a copyright statement or author statement, then it will not magically appear in the report.

ScanCode can be found here:

# Running the script

You can find the help for the program by running the following command:

    $ python3 generate-copyright-list.py --help

which will print:

    usage: generate-copyright-list.py [-h] [-j FILE] [-d DIR]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -j FILE, --json FILE  path to ScanCode JSON file
      -d DIR, --directory DIR
                            top level directory


To analyze results:

    $ python3 generate-copyright-list.py -j /path/to/scancode/json -d /path/to/source/code/directory

For example, if the directory /tmp/busybox-1.28.0/ contains source code that needs to be scanned, then ScanCode can be launched as follows (assuming "scancode" is in the path):

    $ scancode -l -c -n 8 --full-root --json-pp /tmp/scancode.json /tmp/busybox-1.28.0/

This will extract licenses and copyright statements, use 8 threads and write the results to a separate file and it prints the full path (this is necessary, as ScanCode sometimes removes directory names). Then:

    $ python3 generate-copyright-list.py -j /tmp/scancode.json -d /tmp/busybox-1.28.0/

This will print a lot of data on standard out. If you want to write it to a file you can redirect it:

    $ python3 generate-copyright-list.py -j /tmp/scancode.json -d /tmp/busybox-1.28.0/ > /tmp/copyrights.txt

The command above will write the results to the file /tmp/copyrights.txt.

For each file the following will be printed:

* a sequence number
* the path relative to the root (the parameter given to "-d")
* any licenses found
* any copyright statements found

For example:

    31 - archival/bbunzip.c
    
    License(s): GPL-2.0-only, GPL-2.0-or-later, Public Domain
    
    Statement(s): Copyright (c) 1992-1993 Jean-loup Gailly
    (c) 2002 Glenn McGrath
    Copyright (c) 2006 Aurelien Jacobs <aurel@gnuage.org>
    Copyright (c) 1992-1993 Jean-loup Gailly.

It should be noted that ScanCode will not catch every copyright/author statement.
