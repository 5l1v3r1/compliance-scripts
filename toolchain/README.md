There are some situations when an ODM provides a binary only toolchain, but no sources, for example because:

* lost in time (no longer known how it was built)
* never received from the chipset manufacturer
* unwillingness
* thinking it falls under NDA

Whatever the reason, it is sometimes possible to (partially) recreate the toolchain from information obtained from the binaries, or other information, if provided.
